                        <p>"As a working mom preparing for Hari Raya, Zakkir's team saved me so much time! They handled my grocery shopping for festive cooking and even helped deliver kuih to relatives. The assistant remembered all my special requests at the market - like getting the freshest ikan kembong. So thoughtful!"</p>

                        <p>"I run a small law firm and was drowning in paperwork. These guys not only delivered documents to court but actually noticed I forgot to attach an exhibit once and called to check! That attention to detail is priceless when dealing with legal matters."</p>

                        <p>"Since my stroke, going to the post office was hard. Zakkir's assistant Azman not only posts my letters but reads the forms to me and explains in simple Hokkien. Last week he even brought me my favorite tau sar piah from the shop nearby. More like family than service!"</p>

                        <p>"Final exams + part-time job = no time for errands! These guys fetched my laundry at 11pm when I was cramming, and the driver waited 5 extra minutes because I was stuck on a call. Charged me exact toll amount without markup. So different from other services!"</p>
